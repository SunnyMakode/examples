# ZipLongest

Returns a projection of tuples, where each tuple contains the N-th
element from each of the argument sequences. The resulting sequence
will always be as long as the longest of input sequences where the
default value of each of the shorter sequence element types is used
for padding.

```c# --destination-file ../code/Program.cs --region statements --project ../code/TryMoreLinq.csproj
// TODO add example
```
