# RunLengthEncode

Run-length encodes a sequence by converting consecutive instances of the same
element into a `KeyValuePair<T, int>` representing the item and its occurrence
count.

```c# --destination-file ../code/Program.cs --region statements --project ../code/TryMoreLinq.csproj
// TODO add example
```
