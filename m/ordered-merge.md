# OrderedMerge

Merges two ordered sequences into one. Where the elements equal in both
sequences, the element from the first sequence is returned in the resulting
sequence.

```c# --destination-file ../code/Program.cs --region statements --project ../code/TryMoreLinq.csproj
// TODO add example
```

For more details, [see the documentation][doc].
